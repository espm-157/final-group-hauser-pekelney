## NDVI in the Illilouette Creek Basin: Examining changes after the introduction of managed wildfire 🔥 🌲

Hello! Welcome to our repository. Here, we assessed how the introdution of managed wildfire in Yosemite National Park — the Illilouette Creek Basin, specifically — led to significant changes in vegetation. We hope this work will be used to further support the need to introduce wildfire back into ecosystems across the country.
